This repository contains the full implementation and experiments for the paper 'Bayesian Optimization in Latent Variable Models for Expensive Black-Box Problems.' 

The project investigates whether Bayesian optimisation (BO) can be made more effective for high-dimensional black-box functions by operating in a latent space learned by latent variable models (LVMs), specifically PCA, autoencoders (AEs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs).
To further stabilise search in the latent domain, the work also incorporates sequential domain reduction (SDR) trust-region updates.

This project is part of the MEng final-year research project in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Imperial College London.
Background concepts relating to surrogate-based optimisation and BO are informed by the broader literature, including Chanona et al.
